        <h3>my  simple website</h3>
        <p>At early morning we entered in Ajmer city. First we book a nice luxurious hotel. The divine environment and qawwali of the Ajmer Dargah is a great memorial experience. We bought few CDs of qawwali. We traveled the whole important place of the Ajmer like Tara Pahar, Anna Sager, Sai Baaba mandir etc. We saw the biggest kadahi made by emperor Akbar in the dargah campus. We stayed in Ajmer for three days. After that we caught a luxury bus and reached Agra after 12 hours bus journey. These buses have sliper seat. These seats are very comfortable for sleeping. This is first time we slept in a bus journey .
